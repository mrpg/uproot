# uproot

*uproot* is a modern experimental framework built on FastAPI. We are working on producing the first alpha version (0.0.1), and invite you to join us. *uproot* is 100% [Free/Libre Open Source Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software), and contains only unencumbered code.

**NOTE**: This repository contains a *pre-alpha version* -- **DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**.

# Getting started

Run this from within a Python venv:

```console
(env) you@computer:~$ pip install -U 'uproot-science[dev] @  https://github.com/mrpg/uproot/archive/master.zip'
```

Then, you may do:

```console
(env) you@computer:~$ uproot setup my_project
```

The resulting output shows you how to proceed. Have fun!
